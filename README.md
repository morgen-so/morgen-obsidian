## FAQ

### Do my tasks get synced to my Morgen mobile app?

Not right now but please feel free to send us some feedback

### Can I sync Obsidian notes themselves as tasks in Morgen?

At the moment only checklist tasks within notes are synced, but we are
considering the possibility of using the frontmatter of notes to sync them
as a parent task or a task sub-list.

## Future

 - Support for notes as tasks
 - Support for the [Obsidian Kanban Plugin](https://morgen.canny.io/feature-requests/p/obsidian-integration-kanban-plugin-support)
 - Extended functionality provided by this plugin
